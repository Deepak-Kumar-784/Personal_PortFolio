## About

This is my personal portfolio website, meticulously crafted from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective of this project is to provide a dynamic and visually appealing platform to:

- Showcase my diverse skills
- Highlight significant projects
- Present my professional background in an accessible way

I designed the portfolio with a clean, modern, and minimalistic user interface that is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal experience across devices — whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

Beyond being a digital resume, this project also reflects my practical understanding and application of fundamental web development technologies.
